## EchoVue

AI focused data-intelligence built on top of an intuitive webapp. Combine different Data Sources and enhance them with Predictive or Generative AI to generate new insights from your data. 

Including:
* Alerting
* Reporting
* Exporting of enriched data
* Audit Logs (Public-/Private-Key based publicly accessible and verifiable anonymized log, so you can verify what we did)
* Blockchain Support (Notary Logs, Smart Contracts)

We support the following data sources out of the box:

1. Sensors (From Temperature to Gyroscopes, easily integrated)
2. Camera Images (Still Images, Video, RGB, Multispectral, Aerial, ...)
3. Satelite Images (Radar, Gas, Temperature, Multispectral, Stereoscopic, ...)
4. Webcam Feeds (Video, Still Images)
5. Laser PointClouds (In any Projection & Density)
6. Weather (From Indoor Sensors to Weather APIs, Historic and Forecast)

We do the work but you still own your data.
